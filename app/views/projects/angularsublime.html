<p>
    This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that supports the features provided by the generator-angular yeoman generator. Instead of having to tab out of sublime, open up a terminal, then enter in exhaustingly long "yo angular:route myroute", then tab back into sublime, and finally open up the files that were created; just open up the command palette, type route, enter a name, and let the plugin do the rest.
