<p>Angular-Notifications is an easily reusable component for building Angular.js applications that need to use some sort of notifications like Growl or Android. It also allows one to seamlessly use HTML5 notifications if preferred.</p>

<p>This component comes with a $notification service that allows you to easily send notifications across your application under various circumstances like 'warning', 'error', 'success', 'info', or 'loading'. When your application starts passing around notifications, you may want to display all of them in some sort of drop down at some point. $notification allows you to query for all or certain notifications.</p>

<p>Angular-Notifications also comes with an easy to use directive that displays notifications for you without any work at all. This directive is completely optional, and the style of the notification is up to you if you don't like the default one.</p>
