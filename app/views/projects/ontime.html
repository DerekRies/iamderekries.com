<p>OnTime is a Task Management and Time Logging application that was built as part of a group project for a User-Experience class. My role on the project was primarily technical. As a group we concepted out the various features the application would need and the overall user interaction. When it came time to actually build it, I implemented the API for our data, and the client side application in Angular.js. Other group members handled reusable components, css, and assets.</p>

<p>OnTime lets you create Projects and within each project create tasks, like any other task management application. Except OnTime allows you to record the time you spend on each of these tasks, which is great for seeing which parts of projects generally take you the longest and helping you get better with your time estimates. Additionally, most task management applications are usually pretty dull; OnTime is designed to feel fast, responsive, and fun.</p>
